1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?
# Answer: Fashion MNIST is a machine learning dataset similar to MNIST, but it conatains pictures of clothing items instead of handwritten digits.
2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?
# Answer: Image pixel normalization improves training effiency, stability, and overall learning performance.
3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.
# Answer: 
# Input Layer - Takes in the image pixel as input.
# Convolutional Layer - Finds important features in the images, like edgees and shapes.
# ReLU (Activition) Layer - Helps the network learn better by adding non-lineary.
# Pooling Layer - Reduces the size of image data and keeps the important features.
# Flattern Layer - Changes the image data into in one-dimentional list.
# Dense (Fully Connected) Layer - Used the learned features to make decisions.
# Output Layer (Softmax) - Give the final reuslt by showing probability of each class.
4. What does an epoch mean in model training?
# Answer: An epoch means the model has gone through all the training data once.
5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.
